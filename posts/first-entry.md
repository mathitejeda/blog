# WELL WELL WELL

So, here's Mathi reporting from Argy!. Nothing much to say, especially because i actually don't do this thigs often but i thing its goot to give it a shot!.

I don't have much to say so i'll start from the reason i do this. Well there's more than one reason, the main one is learn to use nextjs and react, i never used any of this tools so i though it was a good practice. The second reason is to practice my english. As a person with spanish as a first language i don't have the oportunity to speak in english often. Anywaay i cant have much feedback now because this page is really basic, but my plan is to add features while i learn to use the tools.

That said, i'll leave it here  with a little roadmap with the stuff i plan to add in 2024 to this blog:
- Interaction to posts (likes, comments, etc)
- Update next version, with the new releases and the tutorials (tutorial hell ftw) i cant learn the new tooling so i can add features in a more efficient way.
- Migrate current styles to tailwind. My way to become the ultimate soydev should not exclude tailwind!

Nothing more to say. In future post i'll probably talk more about myself. Bye for now!
